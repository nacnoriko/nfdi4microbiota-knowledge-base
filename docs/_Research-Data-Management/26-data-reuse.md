# Benefits and drawbacks

Making data reusable benefits researchers who publish their data, researchers who reuse data, and society. 

Researchers who publish their data see an increase in their scientific reputation, citations and collaborations {% cite rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. In addition, researchers who publish their data not only comply with the [FAIR Data Principles](https://nfdi4microbiota.github.io/nfdi4microbiota-knowledge-base/Research-Data-Management/04-fair), but also avoid bias in the body of evidence {% cite IOM_2015 %}, increase transparency and thus trust in research {% cite engelhardt_2022 rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Finally, by sharing their resources and perspectives, researchers who publish their data enable other researchers to build on their work, accelerating scientific discovery {% cite engelhardt_2022 IOM_2015 rehwald_2022 %}.

Researchers can recycle unique data by performing secondary analyses to answer new research questions and/or with new methods {% cite rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Reusing data in this way saves resources such as time, energy and money {% cite engelhardt_2022 FSD rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Data reuse also increases collaboration and, over time, enables the comparison of different samples {% cite rehwald_2022 pauls_2023 %}. Indeed, data reuse is essential for interdisciplinary experiments and cross-cutting research approaches {% cite pavone_2020 %}.

Making data reusable can also benefit society. It reduces unnecessary experimentation {% cite rehwald_2022 %}, avoids duplication of data collection and minimises collection from hard-to-reach, vulnerable or over-researched populations {% cite FSD rehwald_2022 %}. It also enables replication and thus promotes reproducibility. Finally, it benefits teaching and improves the link between academia and industry {% cite rehwald_2022 %}.

As suggested by Sielemann *et al.* 2020 {% cite sielemann_2020 %}, there are also challenges, limitations and risks associated with data reuse.

For researchers who publish their data, preparing datasets for reuse is time-consuming. 

For researchers reusing data, there are risks such as unknown quality and denormalisation (i.e. "the same data is stored multiple times in the same database under different names/identifiers"). There is also the challenge of comparing and integrating datasets from different sources {% cite sielemann_2020 %}.


## Resources to facilitate data re-use in microbiology
Below are listed widely used resources in microbiology which facilitate the re-use of raw data found in the data repositories (see section above). These so-called "secondary databases" provided added value through additional data types for example from data integration or from processing of raw data. For each resource and when available, the FAIRsharing and re3data pages are linked. On the FAIRsharing page, you will find information such as which journals endorse the resource (under "Collections & Recommendations" and then "In Policies"). On the re3data page, you will find information such as the above-mentioned criteria to select a trusted resource. DB = database.

# Criteria for selection trustworthy datasets

Below is a list of criteria for selecting trustworthy datasets {% cite bres_2022 sielemann_2020 %}. As in Sielemann *et al.* 2020 {% cite sielemann_2020 %}, for each possible criterion, several questions to consider are listed.

* **Integrity of the source**
    * Is the source/submitter associated with data fabrication/plagiarism?
    * Is the way missing values handled documented?
 
* **Biases**
    * How was the data generated?
    * Is the data generation clearly and precisely documented?
  
* **Missing metainformation (sparsity)**
    * Do you have all relevant information?
    * Is the information understandable and consistent?
    
* **Integration of datasets from different sources**
    * Is the data comparable?
    * Are the methods used for data generation and analysis well documented and comparable?
    
* **Quality issues**
    * Is the quality high enough to reach your goals?
    * Are there any scores/hints available to check the quality of the dataset?
    
* **Copyright/Legal issues**
    * Are there any restrictions for reuse and publication of the data, especially due to the [Nagoya protocol](https://www.cbd.int/abs/)?
   
* **Further documentation**
    * Is the research purpose/(hypo-)thesis well documented?
    * Is it documented whether the data are raw or processed?

## Strategies to search for data

The Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA) {% cite cessda_2017 %} has produced a list of steps in data discovery. The main ones are outlined below, and you can look at their [website](https://dmeg.cessda.eu/) for the sub-steps.
1. Develop a clear picture of the research data you need
2. Locate appropriate data resources
3. Set up a search query and search the data resource
4. Select data candidates
5. Evaluate data quality

CESSDA also suggests three steps to adjust your search strategy {% cite cessda_2017 %}:
1. Use appropriate words in appropriate fields
2. Broaden your scope
3. Narrow your scope
